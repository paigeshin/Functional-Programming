### Functional programming

- The variables you create are actually constant. They canâ€™t be changed.

### Mutable State

```swift
var age = 54
age = 55
```

- OOP Concept
- Concurrency
- Race Conditions
- Dead Locks (waiting for something)

### Immutable State

- Functional programming
- No issues with concurrency, race conditions, dead locks

### First-Class and Higher-Order Functions

- Higher Order Function: Function that takes function and return another function
- Filter
- Reduce
- Map

### Pure Functions

- The function **always** produces the same output when given the same input
- The function creates **zero** side effects outside of it
